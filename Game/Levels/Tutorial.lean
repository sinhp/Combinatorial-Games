World "Tutorial"
Title "Tutorial World"

Introduction
"
In this world we introduce two basic tactics (`rfl` and `rw`).
We also introduce several mathematical concepts: the (natural) numbers `â„•`,
explicit examples of numbers such as 0 and 3, and addition of two numbers.
The final boss is to prove that `2 + 2 = 4`. Good luck!
