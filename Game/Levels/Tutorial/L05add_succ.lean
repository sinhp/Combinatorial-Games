-- So firstly you have to say how to add `0` to something.
-- And secondly, imagine you've already said how to add `d` to something.
-- Then you have to explain how to add `succ d` to something. Once you've explained
-- those two things, \"That's it!\", or the principle of mathematical recursion,
-- says that you've defined how to add `y` to something for all natural numbers `y`.

-- So we now have two jobs to do, and let's do the simplest one in this level:

Introduction
"
We are defining addition. We have defined `x + 0` but still
need to figure out how to add successors. We need a definition for `x + succ d`,
but we are allowed to assume in our definition that we already know the
answer to `x + d`, because `d` was \"born before\" `succ d`.

Just thinking normally mathematically for a moment, `x + succ d` is one more
than `x + d`, so it's the number after `x + d`. Thus it makes sense to define
a family of hypotheses

* `add_succ (a b : â„•) : a + succ b = succ (a + b)`

`add_succ` is a function which eats two variables and spits out a proof.
For example `add_succ 2 1` is the proof that `2 + succ 1 = succ (2 + 1)`.
The axiom tells you that you can move a `succ` left over an `+`.

`add_zero` and `add_succ` and \"That's it!\" (the principle of mathematical
recursion) now enables us to conclude that we have defined `x + y` for all
numbers `x` and `y`.

We can also now state the theorem about the successor function which has been
part of our mental model: `succ n = n + 1`. See if you can rewrite your
way to a proof of it.
