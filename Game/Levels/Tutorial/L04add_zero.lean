Introduction
"
We have defined all the numbers up to 4 (note that in this game, by \"number\"
  I *always* mean \"natural number\"), but we still cannot state
  the theorem that `2 + 2 = 4` because we have not yet defined addition.
  Let's now fix this.

# The definition of addition

Say `x` and `y` are numbers. How are we going to define `x + y`?
This is where Peano's third axiom comes in. \"That's it\" means
that if you want to define how to add `y` to something, you only have
to say how to do it in the two ways that numbers can be born.
More explicitly, you have to explain how to add zero to something, and how to add
a successor to something. So let's start with adding zero.

We need to decide how to define `x + 0`. We want addition to agree with our intuition,
so we should define `x + 0` to be `x`. Let's throw in a new axiom or hypothesis
or proof or however you want to think about it, saying this:

* `add_zero (a : ℕ) : a + 0 = a`

In fact `add_zero` is a *family* of proofs. For example `add_zero 37` is a proof
that `37 + 0 = 37`, and `add_zero (p * q)` is a proof that `p * q + 0 = p * q`.
Mathematicians might encourage you to think of `add_zero` as just one proof:

* `add_zero : ∀ (a : ℕ), a + 0 = a`

but here it is very helpful to invoke the principle coming from computer science
(not always true, but true here) that a proof is the same as a function. Lean
is a functional programming language and you should think of `add_zero` as a function
which eats a number and spits out a proof.

  Hint "I will walk you through this level so I can show you some
  techniques which will speed up your proving.

  This is an annoying goal. One of `rw [add_zero a]` and `rw [add_zero 0]`
  will work, but not the other. Can you figure out which? Try the one
  that works."

    rw [add_zero 0]
    Hint "Walkthrough: Now `rw [add_zero a]` will work, so try that next."
    rw [add_zero a]
    Hint "OK this is getting old really quickly. And if we end up with more complex
    goals and have to type weird stuff like `rw [add_zero (a + 0)]` it will be
    even worse.

    Fortunately `rw` can do smart rewriting. Go back to the very start
    of this proof by clicking \"Delete\" to remove all the moves you've
    made so far and then try `rw [add_zero]` few times. Then delete all of
    these and try `repeat rw [add_zero]`.
    "
  repeat rw [add_zero]
  Hint "`rw [add_zero]` will change `? + 0` into `?`
    where `?` is arbitrary; `rw` will use the
    first solution which matches for `?`."

LemmaDoc MyNat.add_zero as "add_zero" in "Add"
"`add_zero n` is a proof that `n + 0 = n`.

This is one of the two axioms for addition."

DefinitionDoc Add as "+" "`Add a b`, with notation `a + b`, is
the usual sum of natural numbers. Internally it is defined by
induction on one of the variables, but that is an implementation issue;
All you need to know is that `add_zero` and `zero_add` are both theorems."

Conclusion

Let's now learn about Peano's second axiom for addition, `add_succ`.
