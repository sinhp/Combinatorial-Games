Introduction
"
Remember Peano's axioms:

* `add_zero x : x + 0 = x`
* `add_succ a b : a + succ b = succ (a + b)

If you don't need precision about exactly what to rewrite, then you can skip the
variables `x` and `a`, `b` when rewriting.

Remember also the definitions of numbers:

* `one_eq_succ_zero : 1 = succ 0`
* `two_eq_succ_one : 2 = succ 1`
etc up to 5.

Can you prove `2 + 1 = 3`?

  Hint "Which one of Peano's axioms do we ultimately want to use to rewrite that addition?"
  Hint (hidden := true) "change `1` to `succ 0` with a rewrite, and then
  think about Peano's axioms."

Are you up for `2 + 2 = 4`?
