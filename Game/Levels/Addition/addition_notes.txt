succ_add before add_assoc!

Can you do then induction on any of a, b, c?

Put yourself in editor mode and see which is easiest

add_right_comm should be add_left_comm

Set them a maze. simp only [mul_assoc] and then use add_right_comm. Teaches them about
dropping terms in `rw`.

Then do even numbers.

add_add_Add_comm needed in addition world for isEven_add_isEven
but we should make `ac_rfl`
