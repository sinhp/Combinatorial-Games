Introduction
"
Oh no! On the way to `add_comm`, a wild `succ_add` appears. `succ_add`
is the proof that `succ(a) + b = succ(a + b)` for `a` and `b` in your
natural number type. If we knew `add_comm` already we could use that and
`add_succ`, but we don't. Indeed we will need `add_succ` to defeat
`add_comm : ∀ a b, a + b = b + a` in the next level.

NB: think about why computer scientists called this result `succ_add` .
There is a logic to all the names.

Note that if you want to be more precise about exactly where you want
to rewrite something like `add_succ` (the proof you already have),
you can do things like `rw [add_succ (succ a)]` or
`rw [add_succ (succ a) d]`, telling Lean explicitly what to use for
the input variables for the function `add_succ`. Indeed, `add_succ`
is a function: it takes as input two variables `a` and `b` and outputs a proof
that `a + succ(b) = succ(a + b)`. The tactic `rw [add_succ]` just says to Lean \"guess
what the variables are\".

"`succ_add a b` is a proof that `succ a + b = succ (a + b)`."

/--
For all natural numbers $a, b$, we have
$ \operatorname{succ}(a) + b = \operatorname{succ}(a + b)$.
